# This project is Autonomous Data Reality Engine (ADRE)

Core idea:
Building an MCP-powered system that continuously ingests raw, messy, real-world data, evaluates its own confidence in that data, cleans it, cross-validates it, and decides whether it deserves to become training knowledge.

Advantages:
1. Helpful in making LLM to autonomously check and validate the data.
2. This helps in making LLMto question about the data and not just accept freely.
3. LLMs are weak in understanding the nature of the data and this creates issues of bad data which also goes in training with it.
